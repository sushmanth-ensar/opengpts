This code defines two asynchronous functions, `getAssistant` and `getAssistants`, for fetching data from a server. The data pertains to "assistants" and is expected to be of type `Config`. The functions handle the fetching process and manage errors gracefully.

### Imports

```javascript
import { Config } from "../hooks/useConfigList";
```
- **Purpose**: Imports the `Config` type from the specified path. This type is used to ensure that the fetched data conforms to the expected structure.

### Functions

#### `getAssistant`

```javascript
export async function getAssistant(assistantId: string): Promise<Config | null> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/assistants/${assistantId}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      return null;
    }
    return (await response.json()) as Config;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch assistant:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: Fetches the data of a specific assistant by its `assistantId`.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `assistantId`: A string representing the unique identifier of the assistant.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to an object of type `Config` if successful, or `null` if there is an error or the response is not ok.
- **Logic**:
  - Uses the `fetch` API to send a GET request to `/assistants/${assistantId}`.
  - Checks if the response is ok (status code is 200-299).
  - If the response is not ok, returns `null`.
  - If the response is ok, parses the response JSON and casts it to `Config`.
  - If an error occurs during the fetch or JSON parsing, logs the error to the console and returns `null`.

#### `getAssistants`

```javascript
export async function getAssistants(): Promise<Config[] | null> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/assistants/`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      return null;
    }
    return (await response.json()) as Config[];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch assistants:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: Fetches the data of all assistants.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to an array of objects of type `Config` if successful, or `null` if there is an error or the response is not ok.
- **Logic**:
  - Uses the `fetch` API to send a GET request to `/assistants/`.
  - Checks if the response is ok (status code is 200-299).
  - If the response is not ok, returns `null`.
  - If the response is ok, parses the response JSON and casts it to `Config[]`.
  - If an error occurs during the fetch or JSON parsing, logs the error to the console and returns `null`.

### Summary

These functions are used to retrieve data about assistants from a server. They handle both individual assistant retrieval (`getAssistant`) and the retrieval of a list of all assistants (`getAssistants`). Both functions handle errors gracefully by returning `null` if any issues arise during the fetching or parsing process, and they log the errors to the console for debugging purposes. The use of TypeScript ensures that the data conforms to the expected `Config` type, which helps maintain type safety throughout the application.
